Live application can be found here: https://ms3-football-stats.herokuapp.com/

This is a command-line-interface application designed to pull statistical information on various premier league football teams.
The information can be sorted using a number of different options. This project has been designed for educational purposes and uses the Code Institutes mock terminal to run.

## UX

To begin planning this project I started first with UX, designing the logic of the programme based upon the user stories. As this is a command-line application there is no design featured as HTML & CSS have not been used and the programme runs off a generic code institute mock terminal. Due to the lack of design I concentrated on making the text as neat, tidy and appropriately spaced as possible. This meant it was all clear and easy to read.

### Strategy

User Stories:
- As a user I want to view statistics for each premier league football team
- As a user I want to be able to break down the statistics into various categories
- As a user I want the option to go back to the start of the program while using it
- As a user I want to be able to compare statistics across different teams
- As a user I want to the data presented in a clear easy to read table

### Structure

## Features

The first option presented to you when using this program is to view the entire player list of one of the teams listed on the program.
The players are ordered by position and you can see relevant information for each player. Attached is a screenshot where I inputted 'man united' and got the information on each player for their team:

After this you are then presented with another string of choices. These options are based on position and let you filter players by position from the team you have previously picked. For the example below I picked the midfielders of man united:

The next set of options that appear enable you to filter the information via the 'goals scored' column in the google spreadsheet. Again you picked one of the various team names and you will be presented with a list of the top goal scorers ordered in most goals scored to least.
The example below is the top goal scorers for liverpool:
